                    <p class="text-faded para-align">Frequent flyers are one of the principal causes of overcrowding in US emergency departments (EDs). Frequent flyers are patients who visit the ED for treatment 4+ times a year. It is not clear why frequent flyers visit the ED so often, but it is also highly unlikely that any patient will face a life or death emergency situation 4+ times a year.</p>
                        
                    <p class="text-faded para-align">Their visits to the ED may be due to both a combination of intentional and unintentional misuse possibly because of a lack of proper insurance or adequate medical knowledge. They may be homeless or chronically ill; they may also be malingering. Regardless of their reasons, frequent flyers consume valuable ED resources. Moreover, their dependency on the ED often prevents them from seeking out other options that could be more tailored and beneficial to their health needs. </p>

It is in the best interests of our client, UCI ED, to identify and categorize frequent flyers in order to facilitate interventions targeted at reducing the number of frequent flyers—and by extension, the amount of ED overcrowding.</p>
                        
                    <p class="text-faded para-align">By decreasing overcrowding rates at the ED, it will also allow ED doctors to better focus their care on treating patients with life-or-death conditions, as opposed to also having to care for patients that have health issues that would be more appropriately treated in primary care, urgent care or other medical departments. Ideally, the ED should only care and provide treatment for patients that are dying or in danger of dying within a twenty-four hour period. </p>

                    <p class="para-align">
                        The first relevant academic research we looked into was the South Carolina Public Health Institute (SCPHI)’s  A Report on Frequent Users of Hospital Emergency Departments in South Carolina in 2011 with significant findings about ED frequent flyers. The report explores how the ED is often utilized and examines the characteristics of frequent flyers to better understand why they exist in EDs. SCPHI grouped the major trends for ED utilization into the following categories: visit rates, age and race, insurance status, non-urgent and preventable visits. Specifically, they found from studies that the age groups with the heaviest ED utilization came from infants and elders age 75 and older, followed by people between the ages 19-44 years old. (S, 2011). They also found that nationally, EDs were utilized twice as much by African-Americans compared to whites, but there was no correlation between Hispanics and how often they visited the ED (S, 2011).  From the studies they analyzed, SCPHI also found significance for insurance status being a plausible explanation for frequent flyer visits. Medicaid patients tended to utilize the ED more frequently “than those with private insurance or the uninsured” due to the fact that Medicaid patients have limited to no other choices for care because of how few care providers accept patients with Medicaid as insurance (S, 2011). 
                    </p>
                    <p class="para-align">
                        Furthermore, SCPHI reported that multiple national studies showed that behavioral issues and substance abuse was a major cause for people to frequent the ED.  For example, these national studies included findings about how more than 50% of frequent flyers were also diagnosed with a mental health condition or substance abuse disorder and that the most frequent flyers with behavioral health diagnosis were diagnosed with schizophrenia (S, 2011). To further relate the relevance of this report to our project, the significance of clustering frequent flyers and their needs is not solely to decrease overcrowding rates at EDs, but also to help ED frequent flyers reach a better care for their health issues. The SCPHI’s report supports this claim by explaining how EDs are not always the best option for patients with behavioral health issues since EDs are not staffed or equipped with the proper resources to care for their needs. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="para-align">
                        Their report concludes that “High ED utilization may not be an ‘abuse’ of the ED by most patients, but rather an indicator that the health care needs of these patients have not been met in their usual primary care setting’ (S, 2011). THE SCPHI analysis and report is supported by data that is categorized under top diagnoses for ED Patients. This data is divided into 4 columns with age and frequent vs. infrequent users and whether or not their reasons for visiting were preventable in bold. In conclusion, the data and the findings of the report are relevant to helping us approach the problem and better understand how to sort the ED patient data we will be given by the UCI ED.

                    <p class="para-align">
                        The second relevant academic research we inquired into was the Emergency Department Use in New York City: A Survey of Bronx Patients published in Issue Brief, on November 2000. The Center for Health and Public Service Research at New York University conducted interviews with 669 ED patients ages 18 to 55 at four hospitals in the Bronx. They asked the patients about the reasons that they came to the emergency department. They found that only 13.7 percent of respondents came to the ED because of an emergency condition, whereas 34.1 percent of respondents reported that it was the convenience and level of service that attracted them to the ED. They then asked the patients of the duration of their condition or if they had any illness prior to their ED visit. They found that 60 percent of respondents had been ill at least three days prior to their ED visit. They proposed that if there was alternatives to EDs that did not require patients to wait an extended period of time before getting treated, offered convenient hours and staffs who treated patients with respect, there would be a large chance that these frequent ED visitors would seek care in those sites. They also suggested that improving primary care could be a potential solution to reduce the number of preventable ED visits. Specifically, being responsive to patients’ needs, developing infrastructure, re-engineering service, “making primary care available at nights and on weekends”, increasing the telephone consultation could all be used to develop primary care system, and thus fundamentally diverting non-emergent patients from EDs toward primary care facility (Billings, 2000).

                    <p class="para-align">
                        The third relevant academic research paper we looked into was the “Redefining Frequent Emergency Department Users” published by George Washington University in Issue Brief, on April 2014. The author discusses the misconceptions about frequent flyers and proposes solutions on how this varied and complex issue can be solved. The paper explains how complex the problem with frequent flyers is by talking about the economic, social, medical, mental, and political standpoints. Also, it provides multiple examples of  hospitals where interventions were conducted in order to help pinpoint better solutions. For example, in a clinical case management conducted in San Francisco General Hospital, patients were assigned to a social worker wo each possessed a comprehensive case management model. Each model entailed several different kinds of problems with the correct service that it could benefit from. Ultimately, frequent flyers are only part of  more complex problem and the underlying issues need to be address before and form of progress can be made (Waldner, 2014).

                    It is in the best interest of our client, UCI ED, to identify and categorize frequent flyers in order to facilitate interventions targeted at reducing the number of frequent flyers—and by extension, the amount of ED overcrowding. Identifying groups of ED frequent flyers and their specific needs will help reduce ongoing UCI ED costs and resources and allow ED doctors to better focus their care on patients in a life or death condition.</p>
